A data analytics project providing insights into vegetable store sales trends, inventory management, and customer preferences.

# Introduction
VeggieVista is a data analytics project focused on analyzing sales and inventory data for a vegetable store. The project aims to provide insights into sales trends, inventory management, and customer preferences using data visualization and statistical analysis.

# Data
The dataset includes sales data for four types of vegetables over three months. The columns in the dataset are:
- Date: The date of the transaction

- Price Per Unit: The selling price per unit of the vegetable
- Supplier: The supplier of the vegetable

# Methodology
1. Data Cleaning:
   - Handled missing values and inconsistencies in the dataset.
   - Standardized date formats and ensured all data entries were accurate.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   - Visualized sales trends over time using line charts.
   - Analyzed the relationship between inventory levels and sales using scatter plots.
   - Identified top-selling vegetables and seasonal trends using bar charts and heatmaps.

3. Data Visualization:
   - Created dashboards using Power BI to provide interactive insights into sales and inventory data.
   - Used Python libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn) for creating detailed plots and charts.

4. Statistical Analysis:
   - Performed correlation analysis to identify significant factors affecting sales.
   - Conducted hypothesis testing to determine the impact of pricing strategies on sales volume.

 # Results
- Sales Trends: Identified peak sales periods and the most popular vegetables during different months.
- Inventory Insights: Discovered patterns in inventory depletion and restocking needs.
- Customer Preferences: Analyzed customer buying behavior and preferences for specific vegetables.

# Conclusion
The VeggieVista project provided valuable insights into the vegetable store's sales and inventory management. The analysis helped in optimizing stock levels, understanding customer preferences, and improving overall sales strategies.
